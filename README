Shot.js

The Shot.js project is implemented in JavaScript. It implements
a headless terminal app/web service to render websites to PNG, JPG or PDF
on the server side. It's a cross-platform app that runs on Windows,
Linux, Mac OS X. It's Open Source software (New BSD License).

Simply spoken: Shot.js makes screenshots of web sites on the
server side (headless).

It can be controlled by it's command line interface (CLI)
or it's restful HTTP webservice. So you can create screenshots of
e.g. your fancy client side charts.

You can remote-control Shot.js by PHP, Java, PHP, C, [any lanuage]
using curl, [arbitary HTTP client lib] or executing phantom.js / Shot.js
by CLI / posix process create.

Call ./phantom Shot.js for a detailed API description.

This project allows you to generate e.g. PDF reports on the server side
and integrate your fancy client side chart graphics with them.

Attention: Flash or any other third-party plugin is unsupported inside
of the target website (See phantomjs.org mailing list) in favor of having
NO bindings to GUI libs (REAL headless).
